# Books-to-talk-about

 This code is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple interactive web page with a dark mode switch and a task list.

HTML: The HTML part of the code creates the structure of the webpage. It includes a switch for toggling dark mode, a section for book discussions, and an input field for adding thoughts about the book.

CSS: The CSS part of the code styles the webpage. It includes styles for the container, switch, slider, text input, button, and list. It also includes styles for the dark mode, which changes the background and text colors when activated.

JavaScript: The JavaScript part of the code adds interactivity to the webpage. It includes two main functionalities:

Dark Mode Toggle: When the checkbox with id mode-switch is checked, the dark-mode class is added to the container, activating the dark mode styles. When the checkbox is unchecked, the dark-mode class is removed, deactivating the dark mode.

Task List: When the button with id addTaskBtn is clicked, the text from the input field with id taskInput is added as a new list item in the task list with id taskList. Each list item also includes a ‘Remove’ button that, when clicked, removes the corresponding list item from the task list.

This code demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create an interactive and dynamic webpage. The HTML provides the structure, the CSS provides the styling, and the JavaScript provides the interactivity.
